🏗️ Tech Stack – CHAINRAILS™ Phase 2

Core:

Node.js + TypeScript → API layer + service logic

Express.js → RESTful routing

Axios → Phase 1 API integration

XRPL.js → XRPL ledger interaction

Dev & Ops:

Docker + K8s-ready → containerized deployment

dotenv → environment variable management

Jest (optional) → testing

Phase 2 Features:

Compliance Pipeline → KYC/AML/ESG pre-checks

RVR Anchoring → Resurrection Verification Records

ACE Monitoring → Autonomous Covenant Executor (NOVA 1000 logic enforcement)

Dashboards/Alerts → Operator + regulator visibility

⚡ You can either:

Add this directly to your README.md under a “Tech Stack” section, OR

Create a new file at /docs/STACKS.md and keep it modular.

👉 Do you want me to format this as a drop-in section for README.md (like your Phase 1 style) or as a standalone /docs/STACKS.md file?

🏗️ Tech Stack – CHAINRAILS™ Phase 2
⚙️ Core

Node.js + TypeScript → API layer + service logic

Express.js → RESTful routing

Axios → integration with Phase 1 API

XRPL.js → interaction with the XRPL ledger

🛠️ Dev & Ops

Docker + Kubernetes-ready → containerized deployment for scale

dotenv → environment variable management

Jest (optional) → unit + integration testing

🔑 Phase 2 Features

Compliance Pipeline → KYC/AML/ESG pre-checks before settlement

RVR Anchoring → Resurrection Verification Records for continuity & recovery

ACE Monitoring → Autonomous Covenant Executor (NOVA 1000 logic enforcement)

Dashboards & Alerts → Operator + regulator visibility

📑 Notes

Phase 1 = core settlement engine.

Phase 2 = compliance + continuity + ACE monitoring.

Modular design → can run side-by-side with Phase 1 or integrate via APIs.
