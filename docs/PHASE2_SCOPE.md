# ðŸš† CHAINRAILSâ„¢ Phase 2 â€“ Design

**Purpose:** Build on Phase 1 rails by adding compliance-native checks, continuity (RVRs), and ACE monitoring.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Phase 2 Features
- **Compliance-first pipeline** â†’ KYC/AML/ESG validation before settlement.  
- **Resurrection Verification Records (RVRs)** â†’ Immutable anchoring of continuity so no data/state loss.  
- **ACE integration** â†’ Leverage NOVA 1000â€™s Dimensional Cognition Cube for incorruptible logic enforcement.  
- **Dashboards & Alerts** â†’ Operator-friendly visibility for ops teams and regulators.  
- **Benchmarking** â†’ Stress tests across corridors (USDâ€“SGD, USDâ€“AED, INRâ€“SGD).

## ðŸŒ‰ Interaction with Phase 1
- Consumes Phase 1 API at `PHASE1_BASE_URL`.  
- Adds pre-settlement KYC/AML checks + RVR anchoring.  
- Exposes its own API for ACE + dashboards.  
- Never mutates Phase 1 logic â€” Phase 1 stays the single source of truth.  

---

## ðŸ“‘ Notes
- **Phase 1** = settlement engine.  
- **Phase 2** = compliance + continuity + ACE.  
- Both can stay in separate repos until a monorepo decision is made.  
- Designed to be modular: you can run Phase 2 side-by-side with Phase 1, or link via APIs only.  
ðŸš€ Next steps for you:

In your new Phase 2 repo â†’ Add file â†’ Create new file.

Copy each file above into its matching filename.

Commit them to main.

Your repo will be clean, documented, and runnable with npm run dev.
