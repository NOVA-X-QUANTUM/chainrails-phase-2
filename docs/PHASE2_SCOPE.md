# 🚆 CHAINRAILS™ Phase 2 – Design

**Purpose:** Build on Phase 1 rails by adding compliance-native checks, continuity (RVRs), and ACE monitoring.

---

## 🔑 Phase 2 Features
- **Compliance-first pipeline** → KYC/AML/ESG validation before settlement.  
- **Resurrection Verification Records (RVRs)** → Immutable anchoring of continuity so no data/state loss.  
- **ACE integration** → Leverage NOVA 1000’s Dimensional Cognition Cube for incorruptible logic enforcement.  
- **Dashboards & Alerts** → Operator-friendly visibility for ops teams and regulators.  
- **Benchmarking** → Stress tests across corridors (USD–SGD, USD–AED, INR–SGD).

## 🌉 Interaction with Phase 1
- Consumes Phase 1 API at `PHASE1_BASE_URL`.  
- Adds pre-settlement KYC/AML checks + RVR anchoring.  
- Exposes its own API for ACE + dashboards.  
- Never mutates Phase 1 logic — Phase 1 stays the single source of truth.  

---

## 📑 Notes
- **Phase 1** = settlement engine.  
- **Phase 2** = compliance + continuity + ACE.  
- Both can stay in separate repos until a monorepo decision is made.  
- Designed to be modular: you can run Phase 2 side-by-side with Phase 1, or link via APIs only.
